SHRDLU - the Clojure/NetLogo robot arm example
you will need to get the Clojure matcher from Clojure tools/resources on agent-domain
I have used strips-search, when you develop your work please use the planner instead (also from agent-domain)
sock2.jar is a NetLogo extension which should be included in a folder called "sock2" in the extensions folder of your NetLogo installation
check the "loading & running" file for details about startup
